## TOR2WEB CONFIGURATION FOR GLOBALEAKS
# This is a minimal configuration template for a Tor2web to be used with
# globaleaks installed on the same server. !WARNING!: That setup is only
# valid for mid/low-risks deployments, such as anticorruption compliance in
# western countries

# Hostname of the public website
basehost = PUBLIC.DOMAIN.CHANGE.ME

# Local IP address Tor2web must be listening
listen_ipv4 = PUBLIC.IP.CHANGE.ME

# Tor Hidden Service
# To find the hostname issue the following command
# cat /var/globaleaks/torhs/hostname
mode = TRANSLATION
onion = hiddenservice.onion

# This allows Tor2web to work as a proxy for a local GlobaLeaks platform
# exposed on http://127.0.0.1:8082
dummyproxy = http://127.0.0.1:8082

# CERTIFICATE CONFIGURATION
# For the commands needed for generating the files below specified refer to the
# wiki page at: https://github.com/globaleaks/Tor2web/wiki/Installation-Guide
ssl_key = /home/tor2web/certs/tor2web-key.pem
#
# LOAD THE .CRT FILE THAT HAS BEEN GIVEN YOU BY YOUR CA
ssl_cert = /home/tor2web/certs/tor2web-cer.pem
#
# LOAD THE INTERMEDIATE CERTIFICATE CHAIN OF YOUR CA HERE
# PLEASE BE CAREFUL TO PUT THE CERT CHAIN IN THE RIGHT ORDER!
ssl_intermediate = /home/tor2web/certs/tor2web-intermediate.pem

# If globaleaks is used in embedded mode uncomment the settings below
# and read https://github.com/globaleaks/GlobaLeaks/wiki/Integration-Guide
# disable_tor_redirection = True
# blockhotlinking = False

# If you want to serve torbrowser files from this server
# uncomment this and read https://github.com/globaleaks/Tor2web/wiki/GetTor
disable_gettor = True

# If set to True will disable the tor2web disclaimer
disable_disclaimer = True

# If set to True will disable the tor2web banner
disable_banner = True
