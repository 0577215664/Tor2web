## TOR2WEB CONFIGURATION FOR GLOBALEAKS
# This is a minimal configuration template for a Tor2web to be used
# with globaleaks installed on the same server.
# WARNING: That setup is only valid for mid/low-risks deployments, such as anticorruption compliance in western countries

# Hostname of the public website
basehost = PUBLIC.DOMAIN.CHANGE.ME

# Local IP address Tor2web must be listening
listen_ipv4 = PUBLIC.IP.CHANGE.ME

# Tor Hidden Service 
# To get it issue the following command
# cat /var/globaleaks/torhs/hostname 
onion = ONION.SERVICE.CHANGE.ME

# This allows Tor2web to work as a proxy for a local GlobaLeaks platform exposed on http://127.0.0.1:8082
dummyproxy = http://127.0.0.1:8082

# CERTIFICATE CONFIGURATION
# To generate the certificate KEY and the CSR (Certificate Signing Request)
# to be submited to the Certification Authority use the following command:
# openssl req  -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout /home/tor2web/certs/tor2web-key.pem  -out /home/tor2web/certs/tor2web-csr.pem
#
ssl_key = /home/tor2web/certs/tor2web-key.pem
#
# LOAD THE .CRT FILE THAT HAS BEEN GIVEN YOU BY THE CA ISSUES
ssl_cert = /home/tor2web/certs/tor2web-certificate.pem
#
# LOAD HERE INTERMEDIATE CERTIFICATE CHAIN OF YOUR CA
# PLEASE BE CAREFUL TO PUT THE CERT CHAIN IN THE RIGHT ORDER!!
ssl_intermediate = /home/tor2web/certs/tor2web-intermediate.pem
#
# GENERATE DH PARAMETER FILE WITH
# cd /home/tor2web/certs/ && openssl dhparam -out tor2web-dh.pem 2048
ssl_dh = /home/tor2web/certs/tor2web-dh.pem

# IF GLOBALEAKS IS USED IN EMBEDDED MODE UNCOMMENT THIS
# AND READ https://github.com/globaleaks/GlobaLeaks/wiki/Integration-Guide
# disable_tor_redirection = True
# blockhotlinking = False

# IF YOU WANT TO SERVE TORBROWSER FILES FROM THIS SERVER
# COMMENT THIS OUT and READ https://github.com/globaleaks/Tor2web/wiki/GetTor
disable_gettor = True
