# Tor2web

## Introduction
Tor2web is a web proxy software that let you access Tor Hidden Services from
the Internet under the domain *.tor2web.org (but also many others such as *.onion.to, *.onion.city, *.onion.cab)
rather than by using .onion, reachable only from within Tor Darknet.

Tor2web is now part of a larger project ([GlobaLeaks](https://github.com/globaleaks/GlobaLeaks/wiki/)), and is a crucial point in an architectural design aimed to make Tor Hidden Services (HS) easily reachable for all internet users, even if they have not installed Tor.
